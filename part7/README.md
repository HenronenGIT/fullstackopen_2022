## What I learned

- Using the Redux library by removing states from React components by using hooks API `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.
- Difference between <em>controlled</em> and <em>uncontrolled</em> HTML forms.
- Using Redux toolkit for combining reducers with `createSlice`.
- Refreshing memory by using `JSON-server` again.
- Used Redux thunk library for seperating action controllers from React components.
- Small glance to `connect` function, old way to handle Redux. -->
