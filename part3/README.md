# Part 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

> In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.
